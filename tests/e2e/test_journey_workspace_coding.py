"""E2E test: "terminal coding session" user journey.

Exercises a realistic coding workflow where the agent uses terminal
tools to list files, create a file in ``/tmp``, and read it back.

The ``sys_terminal_test_agent`` provides ``sys_terminal_*`` tools that
drive a real tmux session, so the agent can execute arbitrary shell
commands (``ls``, ``printf``, ``cat``) in its terminal.

Skipped if tmux is not installed on the host.

    Terminal coding journey: create a file via terminal, read it back,
    and verify the content.

    Steps:

    1. Create a session with the ``sys_terminal_test_agent``.
    2. Ask the agent to list the workspace files (``ls``).
    3. Verify ``sys_terminal_read`` output contains file listings.
    4. Ask the agent to create a Python file with a hello-world function.
    5. Ask the agent to read the file back with ``cat``.
    6. Verify the file content appears in tool output.

    The core flow (create → read → verify) is the most reliable subset
    of the full 8-step journey. Modification steps (sed/echo to add a
    docstring) are omitted to reduce LLM flakiness — the create-read
    round trip already proves the terminal is functional.

    **What breaks if this fails:**

    - Terminal tools not registered → agent cannot run shell commands.
    - Workspace cwd not set → file created in wrong location.
    - ``sys_terminal_send``/``sys_terminal_read`` flow broken → no
      command output captured.
    - tmux session not persisting across tool calls within one turn →
      stateful file operations fail.

    :param sys_terminal_test_agent: Registered agent with terminal tools.
