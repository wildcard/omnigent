# Sourced by evaluate-checks.sh. The unit/lint/type-check checks gate every PR.
# The e2e + e2e-ui suites also gate PRs, but only run with secrets on same-repo
# PRs (maintainer branches); fork PRs cannot read the LLM_API_KEY /
# GATEWAY_BASE_URL secrets, so their e2e jobs skip via a workflow fork guard.
# The e2e and integration check names are therefore in BOTH REQUIRED (a
# same-repo PR must pass them) and ALLOW_SKIP (a fork PR's skipped check still
# satisfies the gate).
# Generated file -- do not hand-edit; it is replaced wholesale on every sync.
